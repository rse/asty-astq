About
-----

ASTy-ASTq, as its name implies, is a combination of
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Data Structure library
[ASTy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asty) and the Abstract Syntax Tree
(AST) Query Engine Library [ASTq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astq).
Technically ASTy-ASTq is a super-class of ASTy while it internally
integrates ASTq so that each ASTy node has additional `compile`,
`execute` and `query` methods available. The methods have the folowing
signatures (in TypeScript notation):

    compile(
        selector: String,
        trace?: Boolean
    ): ASTYQuery
    execute(
        query: ASTQQuery,
        params?: { [name: String]: [value: Any] },
        trace?: Boolean
    ): ASTYNode[]
    query(
        selector: String,
        params?: { [name: String]: [value: Any] },
        trace?: Boolean
    ): ASTYNode[]

In other words, the following ASTy-ASTq usage...

    var ASTY = require("asty-astq")

    var asty = new ASTY()
    var node = asty.create("Foo")

    var nodes = node.query("Foo", {}, true)

...is technically equivalent to the underlying ASTy plus ASTq usage onto
which ASTy-ASTq maps itself:

    var ASTY = require("asty")

    var asty = new ASTY()
    var node = asty.create("Foo")

    var ASTQ = require("astq")
    var astq = new ASTQ()
    astq.adapter({
        taste:            function (/* node */) { return true           },
        getParentNode:    function (node)       { return node.parent()  },
        getChildNodes:    function (node)       { return node.childs()  },
        getNodeType:      function (node)       { return node.type()    },
        getNodeAttrNames: function (node)       { return node.attrs()   },
        getNodeAttrValue: function (node, attr) { return node.get(attr) }
    })
    var nodes = astq.query(node, "Foo", {}, true)
